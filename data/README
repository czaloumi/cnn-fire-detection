Images can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/phylake1337/fire-dataset

If you are planning to run fire_detection.ipynb:
  ** Download images and zip them to a file named 'collab.zip'
  ** Upload 'collab.zip' to your Google Drive
  
If you are planning to run any of the resources .py files that use the .flow_from_directory image generator method: 

  ** Download images into THIS data folder!
  ** fire images in a subfolder named 'fire_images'
  ** not fire images in a subfolder named 'non_fire_images'

  This is important so that scripts work to separate out into test-train-val folders :)
